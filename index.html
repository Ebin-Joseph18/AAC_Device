    <h1>AAC Internship - Fablab</h1>
    <ul>
        <h2>9th MAY 2023</h2>
        <p>Initially the interns were tasked with performing their own research and learning about various AAC devices available in the market and to come up with a low to mid tech AAC device.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learn about AAC devices.</li>
            <li>Generated ideas of a prototype AAC device.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Single button AAC device capable of recording the required audio and play it back on demand.</li>
                <li>Simple design to not overstimulate the users.</li>
                <li>Some form of force feedback on activation.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Create a presentation on the prototype.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The prototype is based on the existing design of the BIGmack communictation device:</p>

    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>10th MAY 2023</h2>
        <p>On the second day, the inters were requested to present their ideas infront of a panel of industry experts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Presented the idea to the CEO of Evocube Technologies and the Faculty Incharge of Fablab.</li>
            <li>Valuable feedback was generated through constant communication on the idea:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Since the device is already in the market, was told to make the device innovative and different.</li>
                <li>Take pointers from the communities that the product is marketed to and to see ideas and features through the eyes of the user.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>After the presentation, the inters were tasked with developing a basic sketch/design of the device using any industry standard modelling software.</li>
            <li>Downloaded Autodesk Fusion360 and started on developing a basic prototype.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>11th MAY 2023</h2>
        <p>The interns were focused on learning the fundamental tools in Fusion360 needed to construct a basic design of the device.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With prior knowledge on designing in Fusion360, the day was spent sketching a design on paper before modelling it on Fusion360.</li>
            <li>Multiple view images of the BIGmack communication device helped finalize the design for the prototype device I was tasked to produce.</li>
            <li>Finished the day off by completing the design of the bottom-lid of the device in Fusion360.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The design was a simple to manufacture shape that would intrigue the user.</p>

    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>12th MAY 2023</h2>
        <p>Today was the deadline for presenting the design to the Faculty Incharge.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The top-lid of the device was modelled before deadline and presented.</li>
            <li>Was told to produce a stl file of the sketchs produced for 3d printing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The design was as follows:</p>
        <img src="Design2.png" alt="PreliminaryDesign" />
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>15th MAY 2023</h2>
        <p>The faculty had organised a class headed by the CEO of Evocube Technologies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Was taught the basics of a good design and what was needed to make a design desierbale.</li>
            <li>Was shown some of the devices the company had designed and the difficulties and constraints each part had.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>16th MAY 2023 - 18th MAY 2023</h2>
        <p>The premilinary design for the device underwent further development after receiving valuable insight from the previous class.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Major changes were made to the upper-lid, now having a five degree slope to make it more visualy pleasing.</li>
            <li>The standoffs were redesigned making much more area for threaded inserts to be added.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The finalised design was as follows:</p>
        <img src="Design3.png" alt="FinalisedDesign" />
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>19th MAY 2023</h2>
        <p>A GoogleMeet was scheduled with an Alumni to teach us the basics of the electronics side of the device.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We were provided with links and relevant resources to prototype our device using arduinos.</li>
            <li>We were given valuable tips on how to go about making the device.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>22nd MAY 2023</h2>
        <p>With the product design stage nearly finished, focus was moved to the electronic side of the product.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Aquired an ISD1820 based audio recorder module which would be suitable for my design as it it compact and can be modified easily for the required device.</li>
            <li>Further replacement modules were also researched on, eg: ISD1760.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It was learned that the speakers procured with the voice recorder module provided insufficient volume and depth so it was decided to use an amp along with a speaker with a bigger driver.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Multiple amps were researched on and shortlisted down to two.</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>PAM8406 Digital Amplifier Module With Volume Control Potentiometer 5W - 2 Stereo</li>
                <li>LM386 Audio Amplifier Module</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>23rd MAY 2023</h2>
        <p>Researched online about batteries that can be used with the device and how to regulate its voltage to a safe level for daily use inside the product</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A 2s liPo 1000mAh battery was selected which can provide 7.4v which can further be regulated down to a safe voltage of 5v using a voltage regulator based on an LM7805 IC - 5V Positive Voltage Regulator IC</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Started measuring and designing the standoffs for these modules into the design</p>
    </ul>
